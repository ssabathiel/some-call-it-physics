# some-call-it-physics

Code that implements a finite state machine in Unity3D.
Each state consists of a set of objects with a defined position.
Transitions between states can introduce new objects, delete objects or transform objects from one pose (position+orientation) to another.

The original purpose for this code was to have a tool that allows for an easy workflow for making physics tutorials.
The efficent way to create new states allows to create long story lines quickly, without having to implement repeating transitions manually in other animation software.
